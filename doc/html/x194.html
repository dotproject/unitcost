>	The whole point of the Unicost module is to be able to track
	cost-based progress along with time-based progress which is
	the dotProject standard. Furthermore, we have done some
	changes that force you to update progress through Task Logs
	instead of doing it directly on the task. You will notice that
	when you edit the task, the Progress field is now read-only,
	this is on purpose, and we recommend you do not change this
	(read on). We also recommend that you prevent users from
	deleting and editing Task Logs (with Roles and User Security)
	so you can have an audit trail of progress using the Logs. The
	Unitcost module enhances the standard dotProject log because
	it keeps track on historic performance making it easy not only
	to plot a progress line (or "S" curve) but to do mathematical
	calculations and estimate or forecast based on the historic
	trending. If you allow users to edit and delete the logs, you
	will not be able to take advantage of this enhancement.

>	When you create a new Task Log, you will notice a new section
	that is clearly divided and titled "Unit Cost Report". Only
	tasks with properly configured Unitcosts are allowed to report
	by unit, of course. You will also notice that we did away with
	the percentage drop down list and this field is now a decimal
	number instead of an integer value. If you enter the completed
	units, it will automatically calculate the accumulated
	percentage and vice-versa. The rest of the Task Log
	functionality remains intact, at least with respect to the
	user. Upon save, nevertheless, the system will now keep track
	of historic percentage and unitcost values in an extended log
	table (unitcost_task_log_costs) and will also update the
	accumulated values in the extended tasks table
	(unitcost_task_costs). Furthermore, if you view the Project
	information, you will notice a new field called CProgress
	which shows current cost-based progress based on the logs and
	it's complimentary to the standard Progress field (which is
	time-based).
