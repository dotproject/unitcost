>	The main place where you can observe a major change with
	standard dotProject is in the Tasks application. In both the
	view and edit screens you will now see an extra tab named
	<SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Unitcost</SPAN
> or the term for your particular
	locale translation.
      </P
><P
>	On the view mode of the Tasks application, you can click on
	the Unicost tab and view the Unicost configuration of this
	particular task. If you installed Unicost with existing data,
	it is very likely the fields will be NULL until your first
	save after the installation of the module; this is harmless
	and will not affect the module or your current data.
      </P
><P
>	If you edit the task, you will have access to the write-able
	fields for configuring the Unicost. The Unicost or cost per
	unit, can be broken down into individual Material, Equipment,
	Labor, and Other costs, and will add up in the Total Unit Cost
	field.

>	  Once you start configuring the Unitcost for a task, you must
	  complete it, or return the values to NULL (empty) and
	  save. If you don't complete all the Unicost fields, or make
	  a mistake, there are a series of business rules and
	  validations that will aid you in correctly configuring the
	  Unitcost; the validations are de-activated if all fields are
	  returned to NULL and the system will place some default
	  values for you automatically upon save.

>	The Unit of Measure is a required field and will help you when
	creating a Task Log for this task. The Total Units field will
	calculate the Task Total Cost and along with the Performance
	field is required for saving. The "per" field, which indicates
	the Unit of Time associated with the declared Performance, is
	connected with same field in the Dates tab, which means that
	if you change it here, it will change there and
	vice-versa. Normative reference and Description are just
	reference fields in case this task corresponds to a particular
	norm definition. This is especially useful in construction
	projects but probably applicable in other disciplines. 
      </P
><P
>	Upon save, the Unicost module will update the Task Target
	Budget (effectively useless field in standard dotProject), and
	the project's Actual Budget field with the total cost of all
	tasks (that have Unicost defined, of course). The project's
	Target Budget field is left for user manual entry based on the
	actual budget which is now calculated and read-only. If tasks
	had an Actual Budget field we would have used that one for
	consistency, but they don't, and we did not really want to add
	columns to existing tables to minimize upgrading issues.
