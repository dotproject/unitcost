The documentation is written using SGML Docbook 4.2
To re-generate it you will need all the required tools

Note that source is in UTF-8 so you need to declare
export SP_ENCODING="UTF-8"
before you run jade and other utilities

You must also use the print stylesheet included to preserve the
original look of the document and other requirements by the author
such as the Copyright notice and the License terms.

for a common Linux system or alike just use:

db2ps -d corvus-print-main.dsl unitcost.sgml

No need for the stylesheet with html generation

NOTE: The html generated is also UTF-8 and YOU MUST MAKE YOUR BROWSER
USE UTF-8 BY DEFAULT since the conversion does not add any META tags
that indicate encoding.
